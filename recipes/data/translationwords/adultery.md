* The term “adulterer” refers generally to any person who commits adultery.
* Sometimes the term “adulteress” is used to specify that it was a woman who committed adultery.
* Adultery breaks the promises that a husband and wife made to each other in their covenant of marriage.

## Translation Suggestions:

* If the target language does not have one word that means “adultery,” this term could be translated with a phrase such as “having sexual relations with someone else’s wife” or “being intimate with another person’s spouse.”
* Some languages may have an indirect way of talking about adultery, such as “sleeping with someone else’s spouse” or “being unfaithful to one’s wife.” (See: [euphemism](rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism))
