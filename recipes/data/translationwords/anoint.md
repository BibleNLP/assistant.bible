# anoint, anointed, anointing

## Definition:

The term “anoint” means to rub or pour oil on a person or object. Sometimes the oil was mixed with spices, giving it a sweet, perfumed smell. In biblical times, there were several reasons for anointing someone with oil.

* In the Old Testament, priests, kings, and prophets were anointed with oil to set them apart for special service to God. (This and the other uses are symbolic actions, see [Symbolic Action](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction).)
* Objects such as altars or the tabernacle were also anointed with oil to show that they were to be used to worship and glorify God.
* In the New Testament, sick people were anointed with oil for their healing.
* The New Testament records two times that Jesus was anointed with perfumed oil by a woman, as an act of worship. One time Jesus commented that in doing this she was preparing him for his future burial.
* After Jesus died, his friends prepared his body for burial by anointing it with oils and spices.
* The titles “Messiah” (Hebrew) and “Christ” (Greek) mean “the Anointed (One).”
* Jesus the Messiah is the one who was chosen and anointed as a Prophet, High Priest, and King.
* In biblical times, a woman might anoint herself with perfume to make herself more sexually attractive.
